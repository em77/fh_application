    illness a sense of belonging and the opportunity to form relationships,
    so they can take the vital steps toward mental health. At Fountain House,
    members &amp staff work together in the running of the program. Members
    volunteer their time in various units and, together with staff, ensure
    that the organization is operating smoothly and efficiently. It is by
    working side by side that relationships between and among members and
    staff are developed. Through these relationships and the meaningful
    participation in Fountain House work, members build skills, develop a
    sense of purpose, and strive towards achieving their individual goals.
